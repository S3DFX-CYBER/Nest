### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in OWASP Nettacker, we appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly.

#### **1. Private Disclosure**
- **Do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.
- **Use the GitHub Security Advisory Feature**:
  - Click the **"Report a vulnerability"** button above to submit a **private security advisory**.
  - This method ensures that your report reaches the repository maintainers directly and promptly.

- **Alternative Method (if needed)**:
  - If you cannot use the GitHub Security Advisory feature, send an email to **[github@viraintel.com](mailto:github@viraintel.com)**.
  - Include the following details in your report:
    - A **clear description** of the vulnerability.
    - **Steps to reproduce** the issue (e.g., code snippets, proof of concept).
    - The **affected version(s)** of OWASP Nettacker.
    - Any **potential impact** of the vulnerability (e.g., data exposure, remote code execution).

#### **2. Responsible Disclosure Process**
- We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
- We will work with you to validate and address the vulnerability.
- Once the issue is fixed, we will release a patch and publicly disclose the vulnerability, crediting you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
